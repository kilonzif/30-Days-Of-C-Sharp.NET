About C#

C# is a powerful Object Orientated language, for those coming from Java or C++ you should be
able to pick up the syntax for C# quickly. A few points:
 The language is case-sensitive (So A and a are different)
 Lines terminate with semi-colons
 Code is put in code blocks { }
 Inline comments start with //
 Block comments start with /* */
 XML comments start with ///




Basic Structure 
Every C# program uses this foundational structure. This forms the skeleton of your application. The Program.cs file is the foundation of most C# project types.


using System; // 'using' allows for easier access to types in a namespace.

namespace YourNamespace // Namespaces organize code and prevent naming collisions.
{
    class YourClass // A 'class' defines the blueprint of objects.
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) // 'Main' is where the program starts execution.
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); // Displays text in the console.
        }
    }
}

---about the code ---

The given code is a simple C# program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's a breakdown of the code:

using System;: This line is used to include the System namespace, which contains the Console class that allows for input and output operations.

namespace YourNamespace: This line declares a namespace called YourNamespace. Namespaces are used to organize code and prevent naming collisions.

class YourClass: This line declares a class called YourClass. Classes are used to define the blueprint of objects in C#.

static void Main(string[] args): This line declares the Main method, which is the entry point for the program. It has a parameter of type string array (string[] args).

{}: These curly braces enclose the body of the Main method.

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");: This line uses the Console.WriteLine method to display the text "Hello, World!" in the console.

The code is a basic example of a C# console application that demonstrates how to output text to the console.
